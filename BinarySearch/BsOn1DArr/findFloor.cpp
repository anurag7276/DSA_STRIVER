}

Case 1 - If arr[mid] <= x: The index arr[mid] is a possible answer. So, we will store it and will try to find a larger number that satisfies the same condition. That is why we will remove the left half and try to find the number in the right half.

Case 2 - If arr[mid] > x: arr[mid] is definitely not the answer and we need a smaller number. So, we will reduce the search space to the left half by removing the right half.
